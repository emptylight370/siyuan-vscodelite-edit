# Features

* Style various heading levels(futher change)
* Fine-tune layout and color scheme
* Customize change
* Adjust code block
* Table display style
* Fit some plugins
* Limit display height of embedded block(can close)

# Configure

The theme uses `import` to incorporate different theme modules, and you can adjust the display effect by modifying the comments. For detailed instructions, please check the [Link](https://github.com/lingfengyu-dreaming/siyuan-vscodelite-edit/Configure.md).

I'm thinking use `theme.js` to modify display style. This may release after several versions.
